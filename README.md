I've completed my ConsoleIO class just listing out all of the input/output stuff I'll use

I've also added functionality to the Menu Controller. <br/> I had to add a menu of choices for the user to select(Add Item, Remove Item, Display Cart, Checkout, and Exit)

I've setup my Item class, and decided to have a pre-determined list of items for the user to choose from. <br/> Probably going to have to set up a ArrayList of items and print it to a menu.

I've added some items to an array list as a way for the user to choose which items to list, <br/> and then created an addItemMenu method just to iterate through that list to display all items that can be added.<br/> This was tough to think about at first because I wanted a numbered list in addition.

Right now I'm thinking about how to set up a removeItemMenu that incorporates the list of the cart and not a given list
