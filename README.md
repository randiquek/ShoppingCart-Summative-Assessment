# ShoppingCart-Summative-Assessment

I've completed my ConsoleIO class just listing out all of the input/output stuff I'll use

I've also added functionality to the Menu Controller. <br/> I had to add a menu of choices for the user to select(Add Item, Remove Item, Display Cart, Checkout, and Exit)
</p>

I've setup my Item class, and decided to have a pre-determined list of items for the user to choose from. <br/> Probably going to have to set up a ArrayList of items and print it to a menu.

I've added some items to an array list as a way for the user to choose which items to list, <br/> and then created an addItemMenu method just to iterate through that list to display all items that can be added.<br/> This was tough to think about at first because I wanted a numbered list in addition.

Right now I'm thinking about how to set up a removeItemMenu that incorporates the list of the cart and not a given list.

Was finally able to get my displayCart method working. Was a pain to figure out how to list out a HashMap, <br/> 
and encountered some setbacks in being able to display things. <br/>
Feel like my code is a jumbled mess of variables and properties and trying to incorporate properties and values between different classes

My task is now to get the removeItem method working so I can call it into my removeItemMenu.

Finally implemented removeItem, but didn't for checkout() and getTotal(). <br/>
Probably will add later on as I continue to work on this project.
